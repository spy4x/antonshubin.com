Designing system architecture for your applications can be a daunting task,
especially if you are new to software development or if you are not sure if the
approach you are taking is the right one. Fortunately, with the help of ChatGPT,
you can simplify and streamline the process of designing system architecture. In
this article, we will explore how ChatGPT can assist you in designing system
architecture and highlight its key features.

## Understanding System Architecture

Before we delve into ChatGPT stuff, it is important to understand what system
architecture is. System architecture is the process of designing and building a
software system by breaking it down into smaller components and then defining
how these components will interact with one another. It involves decisions
concerning the structure and behavior of the system and how the individual
components will work together to deliver the desired outcome.

## I Asked ChatGPT to Help

When it comes to system architecture, I usually have an idea of how it should
work. Recently, I started to develop my first browser extension, so I decided to
validate my idea of an architecture for it with ChatGPT. I decided to start
designing a communication between frontend, backend, and database. With
real-time sync of data with other devices of same user.

I was surprised to see that, first, ChatGPT understood my idea and architecture
in detail, second it highlighted the pros and cons my approach, like additional
complexity of scaling WebSocket servers and increased resource usage, as well as
potential data synchronization issues between Postgres and IndexedDB.

Also, ChatGPT helped me generate various diagrams that represent the system
architecture, such as sequence diagrams using PlantUML (diagram as a code). A
sequence diagram is a diagram that shows the sequence of actions that occur when
a user makes a request, from the front-end to the back-end and back again.

Just check it out:

```
@startuml
!define AWSPUML https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml/v14.0/Legacy/

actor User
participant "Frontend\n(Svelte)" as Frontend
database "IndexedDB\n(Dexie.js)" as IndexedDB
participant "Backend\n(Node.js, Prisma)" as Backend
database "PostgreSQL" as PostgreSQL

User -> Frontend: Update user data
Frontend -> IndexedDB: Save updated data
Frontend -> Backend: Send WebSocket message with updated data

Backend -> PostgreSQL: Validate and save updated data
Backend -> Backend: Broadcast updates to other devices

loop Other Connected Devices
    Backend -> Frontend: Send WebSocket message with updates
    Frontend -> IndexedDB: Update data
    Frontend -> User: Update UI
end

And here is the image generated by PlantUML:

## Prompting Best Practices

Using ChatGPT to assist you in designing system architecture is easy. Simply
describe your architecture and request to ChatGPT in detail, and it will provide
you with insights, recommendations, and alternative options. It is important to
provide as much detail as possible to get the most accurate feedback and
suggestions from ChatGPT.

When generating diagrams, such as sequence diagrams, provide ChatGPT with the
necessary information to accurately represent the system architecture. For
example, if you are using WebSockets to synchronize data across multiple
devices, make sure to mention this when describing the architecture to ChatGPT.

Pro tip: Use GPT-4 as a smarter brother of GPT-3.5-turbo for better results!
Your Captain Obvious :)

## Conclusion

ChatGPT helped me to avoid unnecessary complexity at MVP stage of my extension
by highlighting potential drawbacks of my ideas. I believe if you are new to
software development or not sure if your approach is the right one, ChatGPT can
be a valuable resource in guiding you through the process.
