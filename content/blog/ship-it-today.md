## What is it about?

Today I'll share my approach to shipping an app idea. It's a compilation of my
mistakes while working on my projects and what my freelance clients did.

I'll motivate you to start right where you are, and with skills you already
have.

Future articles will cover marketing, fundraising, technical infrastructure, and
other topics vital for the next steps.

## Who is it for?

Software and application developers that have built dozens of applications for
their clients, but not sure how to apply the experience collected along the way.

Perhaps you have started dreaming about launching your startup: your big thing,
your rules, no more confusing tasks from your clients.

Maybe you even have your notes highlighting the ideas of what you can build. You
are all set for your sailing.

By the way, if you want to know how I maximized time for my startups,

Ok, so what's next?

## What to build?

It may sound weird, but you may not need a planet-size idea or a game-changer
app. Your creation doesn't even have
<a href="https://youtu.be/B8C5sjjhsso" target="_blank">to make the world a
better place</a>. That would be awesome though.

> Sometimes all you need is just to help a group of people to get rid of their
> **small itch**.

It can be something as small and simple as making a good
<a href="https://inkdrop.app/" target="_blank">markdown editor</a>, a user
<a href="https://www.upvoty.com/" target="_blank">feedback platform</a>, or a
<a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/" target="_blank">SaaS boilerplate</a>.

Many apps of our days are overloaded with too many features and overwhelming UI.
Sometimes all you need to outcompete your competitors is a high-quality product
and a minimalistic approach.

Keeping things small will let you build a meaningful solution faster, reach your
core audience easier and focus on what matters for MVP.

Note that when you start thinking about what "idea" to implement, you draw
castles in the air - "Good to have" things, but unreal or useless.

In contrast, when you think about "what pain can I solve" - your focus is on a
real issue, which hurts someone every day.

Ideally, you choose something that is your personal itch. Something that you
understand, something that you can judge if it solves the issue or not.

When you work with your own pain - you don't need a group of testers. You are
your best tester. You are part of your core audience. You can see the problem
from the inside, instead of guessing about other people's pain.

But make sure that others have this itch too. Some market research should be
considered. Maybe talk to potential customers, use survey questionnaires, etc to
see if you share the same pains.

Ok, so you've chosen what to build (great if you did some research about
competitors first) and you are ready for the next step, implementing your
solution.

## How to build it?

You need to think about the features of your solution and what building blocks
they will require. From design to frontend, to backend, to architecture. Diving
into each will easily go beyond this article's borders, so let's define the core
principles.

1. Keep it as simple as possible in the beginning. That will let you move fast
   and change directions quickly during experimentation.
2. Stick with your stack. The technology stack doesn't matter much now. You'll
   alter it multiple times in the future. Just start with whatever stack you are
   familiar with the most.
3. It doesn’t have to be perfect. You'll most probably change the form of your
   solution multiple times before it stabilizes in the form that works. You can
   polish it when you have a ready solution available.

Let's look at each principle deeper.

### Keep it simple stupid

You don't need complications at this stage. Things like linting, unit-/e2e-
tests, and CI/CD automation are best practices. However, it’s best to keep them
for a later stage.

Do not let yourself drown in setting up everything for production.

Remember that right now you just need to start. Once you have started and
published something, you can go step by step to improve your dev workflow. Where
it makes sense. When it makes sense.

### Stick with your stack

To start you don't need to learn
<a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" target="_blank">"yet another fancy JS
framework"</a> (although it can be tempting and be an incentive to start). Just
take your favorite stack, the thing you are the most experienced with.

Sometimes you may get stuck thinking that your old bro [put your stack name
here] is not good enough. Leave such thoughts away. You'll change it later.
Maybe. Or maybe never.

In any case, your end users do not care which tech you use if your solution
solves their issue.

![Use what you are experienced with](/img/blog/ship-it-today/use-what-you-are-experienced-with.webp)

In one of my future articles, I'll share a technical stack that I use for my
projects.

### Let it be not perfect

Perfectionism can block you from ever shipping.

Many of my clients spent years developing a fully functioning app with dozens of
features without marketing and user feedback.

Unfortunately for some of them, this whole path was only to realize that the
product is not demanded by the market. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were
spent for nothing (well, maybe for experience?).

Only switch to high-quality code, advanced dev workflow, and multiple features
when you get people's interest and some paying customers. But not earlier than
it's needed.

You can have a big idea in your head. However, for the initial release - try to
cut off everything that you won't need in the first month.

Some SaaS companies leave subscription/payment module implementation for
post-release. They know that they'll have at least 30 days to implement it. And
it's totally fine.

Publish it lean, make it grow muscles, and become polished over time.

## When to build?

I have a rule - "Publish something today and improve it every day". When this
article is live, my website is half done and lacks a lot of features. But

> It's better to have a solid half than a shitty whole.

Don't worry much, no one remembers when Google was published. Make yourself a
24h hackathon, develop a single-feature MVP, and just
